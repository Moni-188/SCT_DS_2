# Exploratory Data Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand passenger survival patterns using interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## 📊 Project Overview
The dashboard analyzes passenger data by exploring relationships between survival status and key variables such as gender, passenger class, age, and fare.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze survival distribution of passengers  
- Compare survival rates by gender and passenger class  
- Visualize age distribution of passengers  
- Examine the relationship between fare and survival  

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Passenger Count by Survival Status  
- Survival by Gender  
- Survival by Passenger Class  
- Age Distribution of Passengers  
- Fare vs Survival  
- Interactive gender filter for dynamic analysis  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI (or Python / Excel — mention what you used)  
- Data visualization and EDA techniques  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Survival rates vary significantly by gender  
- Higher passenger classes show better survival outcomes  
- Younger age groups form a major portion of passengers  
- Passengers who survived generally paid higher fares  

## ✅ Conclusion
This EDA dashboard demonstrates how data visualization and exploratory analysis can be used to extract meaningful insights and patterns from real-world datasets.
